brcm,bcmbt-rfkill
-----------------

A simple GPIO based RFKILL driver to driver regulator and reset lines the
Broadcom Bluetooth chips.

Required properties:

 - compatible : must be "brcm,bcmbt-rfkill"

Optional properties:

 - brcm,vreg-gpio: GPIO to control the voltage regulator of the Bluetooth chip.

 - brcm,n-reset-gpio: GPIO to reset the Bluetooth chip.

Atleast one of the above GPIOs must be configured for the driver to function.

Example:

AON GPIO pin 6 connected to the Bluetooth chip RESET pin. No regulator GPIO pin
available.

bcmbt_rfkill {
	compatible = "brcm,bcmbt-rfkill";
	brcm,n-reset-gpio = <&upg_gio_aon 6 0>;
};
